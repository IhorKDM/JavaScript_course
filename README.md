## Functions - closer look

- Functions are a fundamental part of JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate code for reuse and organization.
- Functions can take parameters and return values, making them powerful tools for building complex applications.

- Functions can be defined in several ways, including function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions. Understanding how to use functions effectively is crucial for mastering JavaScript.

- Functions can also be higher-order functions, meaning they can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for powerful patterns like callbacks and promises, which are essential for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

- Functions can also be nested, meaning you can define a function inside another function. This is useful for creating closures, which allow inner functions to access variables from their outer function's scope.

- Functions can also be anonymous, meaning they do not have a name. This is often used in situations where you need to pass a function as an argument or return it from another function.

- Functions can also be self-invoking, meaning they execute immediately after they are defined. This is useful for creating isolated scopes and avoiding variable conflicts in the global scope.

- Closures are a key concept in JavaScript, allowing inner functions to access variables from their outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This is useful for creating private variables and encapsulating functionality.
