## Numbers, Dates, Timers: Bankist Project

- Understanding JavaScript's number types: integers, floats, and special values like `NaN` and `Infinity`.

- Using the `Math` object for mathematical operations: `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, `Math.random()`, and more.

- Formatting numbers: converting numbers to strings, using `toFixed()`, and handling currency formatting.

- Working with dates: creating date objects, formatting dates, and manipulating them using methods like `getDate()`, `setDate()`, and more.

- Handling dates: creating, formatting, and manipulating dates.
- Using the `Date` object: understanding how to create and manipulate dates in JavaScript.

- Implementing timers: using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for scheduling tasks.
